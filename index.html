        <article>

            <p>As a DevOps Engineer, I have accumulated several years of experience in hydroacoustic
                systems for
                both
                naval and commercial applications. My primary programming language is Python; however, I have also
                successfully worked with various other languages, including C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and Go.
                Throughout
                my career, I have developed expertise across the entire Linux stack, ranging from the Kernel and
                networking to containerization and applications. I possess practical knowledge in managing highly
                available systems and have actively participated in open source software projects.</p>

            <p>
                I enjoy building robust, innovative, and advanced systems and working alongside motivated individuals.
                Professionally, my interests lie in automation, scalability, and performance. I have a passion for
                efficiency and constantly seek to automate manual tasks. Therefore, I firmly believe in Infrastructure
                as Code. Moreover, I hold the belief that mastering the fundamentals opens doors to limitless
                possibilities. While new technologies may be enticing, being stuck often stems from a lack of
                foundational knowledge. This mindset has driven me to gain a deep understanding of the critical
                protocols and standards that shape our modern world.
            </p>

            <p>
                On a personal level, I embody a stoic mindset and approach life with a rational mind. I possess an
                inquisitive and curious nature, always seeking knowledge and exploring new ideas. As a lover of the
                cultivated exchange of ideas, I find great joy in engaging in meaningful discussions that broaden my
                perspective. Beyond that, I am a design fanatic, appreciating the aesthetic beauty and thoughtfulness in
                all forms of art and craftsmanship. I strongly believe in the power of meditation and self-healing,
                recognizing the importance of inner balance and tranquility. Being a nature lover, I find solace and
                inspiration in the great outdoors, marveling at its wonders. Additionally, I have a deep interest in how
                ancient philosophy has shaped contemporary thought and ideas, constantly exploring the wisdom and
                insights of the past to navigate the complexities of the present.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have significantly reduced my engagement with social media. Through personal experience, I've come to
                realize that virtual make-believe realities and trivial conversations do not contribute positively to my
                life. While remnants of my previous social media profiles may still exist, they remain abandoned. My
                focus now lies in fostering meaningful dialogues with real people in authentic settings. If you wish to
                connect with me, the most effective means of reaching out are through email, the contact form, or the
                Signal messenger.
