                <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
                <p>I have extensive experience in operating system internals and network protocols, particularly with
                    UDP and TCP stacks. My expertise in system programming languages such as Python complements my
                    software engineering and system design skills.</p>
            </aside>
            <aside>
                <h3>Professional Interests</h3>
                <p>I'm passionate about building robust, scalable, and simple systems. I believe in Infrastructure as
                    Code and the importance of mastering fundamentals. With experience in open source contributions, I'm
                    driven by efficiency, automation, and performance.</p>
            </aside>
            <aside>
                <h3>Personal Philosophy</h3>
                <p>I embrace a stoic and inquisitive mindset, value meaningful discussions, and appreciate design and
                    art. I practice meditation and find inspiration in nature. I prefer authentic connections over
                    social media interactions.</p>

            <p>
                I have experience as a DevOps Engineer specializing in hydroacoustic systems for naval and commercial
                applications. My expertise spans operating system internals, network protocols (including UDP and TCP),
                and system programming languages like Python and C/C++. I've worked extensively across
                the Linux stack—from Kernel and networking to containerization and applications — while also
                contributing to open-source projects. My focus includes managing highly available systems and applying
                software development and system design principles, always emphasizing quality assurance.
            </p>

            <p>
                I enjoy building robust, innovative, and advanced systems and working alongside motivated individuals.
                Professionally, my interests lie in automation, scalability, and performance. I have a passion for
                efficiency and constantly seek to automate manual tasks. Moreover, I hold the belief that mastering the
                fundamentals opens doors to limitless possibilities. While new technologies may be enticing, being stuck
                often stems from a lack of foundational knowledge. This mindset has driven me to gain a deep
                understanding of the critical protocols and standards that shape our modern world.
            </p>

            <p>
                On a personal level, I value a stoic mindset and rational approach to life. I'm naturally curious and
                enjoy exploring new ideas, finding fulfillment in meaningful discussions that broaden my perspective. I
                appreciate the beauty and thoughtfulness in art and craftsmanship. Meditation and self-healing are
                important to me for maintaining inner balance. Nature brings me solace and inspiration.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have significantly reduced my engagement with social media. Through personal experience, I've come to
                realize that virtual make-believe realities and trivial conversations do not contribute positively to my
                life. While remnants of my previous social media profiles may still exist, they remain abandoned. My
                focus now lies in fostering meaningful dialogues with real people in authentic settings. If you wish to
                connect with me, the most effective means of reaching out are through email, the contact form, or the
                Signal messenger.
